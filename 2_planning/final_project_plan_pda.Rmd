# Project plan

_To meet SQA PDA requirements._

initiated, TO DO

## Context

#### Domain knowledge and the business context

_Briefly describe the business/organisation and where your analysis fits within its aims/activity._

For the purposes of this project, I am imagining I am analysing data for the Energy Saving Trust in Scotland. The Energy Saving Trust aims to ... _purpose, business, audience, etc_

_ADD key points about Scotland's energy profile: https://www.gov.scot/publications/energy-statistics-for-scotland-q3-2022/pages/key-points/_

Here, the (imaginary) brief is to understand how to predict domestic energy consumption according to time and weather. Without having access to sufficiently granular data for domestic energy consumption in Scotland, I am using existing historic data from London households (see below).

#### Business intelligence and data-driven decision making

_Note order of headings swapped with the above._

_What insights can the business/organisation gain from your analysis and how will your analysis help the business/organisation make better decisions?_ 

Understanding which features are good predictors for household energy use enables the business to:

* model energy consumption in upcoming years (and seasons) with different weather scenarios (i.e. as climate changes)
* predict times of high and low energy demand (low demand is important, because renewable sources are often turned down at this time to manage load in the grid)
* calculate potential energy and cost savings from any improvements to domestic energy efficiency

There may also be ways to cluster households by their energy consumption patterns, which may be a useful way to segment domestic energy customers and provide more targeted information and policy recommendations.

## Data

#### Internal and external data sources

The data sources for this project are all external:

1. **London Energy Data** - a single csv file with daily aggregated energy usage for 5,567 London households from November 2011 to February 2014 from the [UK Power Networks' SmartMeter Energy Consumption Data in London Households](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/smartmeter-energy-use-data-in-london-households) project, provided to the public domain (CC0) by Emmanuel F. Werr on Kaggle. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/london-homes-energy-data. (downloaded on August 19, 2023). This csv file contains 3 attributes (household id, date, total energy consumption (in kilowatt-hours, kWh)) and 3510433 observations, where one observation is one household's energy consumption on that date.
2. **London Weather Data** - a single csv file with daily historic weather observations in London from 1978 to 2021 sourced from the [European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECAD)](https://www.ecad.eu/), provided to the public domain (CC0) by Emmanuel F. Werr on Kaggle. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/london-weather-data (downloaded on August 19, 2023). This csv file contains 10 attributes (date, and nine weather measurements, including min, max and mean temperature, number of hours of sunshine and total precipitation) and 15341 observations, where one observation is one day's weather. The weather measurements are a mix of totals, averages, minimums and maximums across the different measures, although it is not clear for some values whether they are totals or averages, since the original [element](https://www.ecad.eu/dailydata/datadictionaryelement.php) code and the cleaning script is not included.
3. **UK Power Networks' original data** - original data from the UK Power Networks' project mentioned above, provided as half-hourly measurements of household energy usage for 5,567 London households, including tariff types, and covering November 2011 to February 2014. URL: https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/smartmeter-energy-use-data-in-london-households (zip file of low-carbon-london-data-168-files (758.86 MB) downloaded on August 19, 2023) and reused here under the [CC-BY license](https://opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by/).

The original research project by UK Power Network included two groups of customers: one group (~1100 households) had dynamic energy pricing, and received warnings about higher and lower prices for the next day; the other set (~4500 households) had fixed prices. The project aimed to understand how pricing warnings might affect energy consumption behaviour.The daily aggregated London energy dataset provided on Kaggle does not include this information about the tariff settings and warnings, therefore there is a missing variable here. However the aggregated data is smaller and easier to work with than the original research data provided by the UK Power Network (which is 167 million rows in total, with half-hourly measurements). Given the timeframe, I have chosen to work with the aggregated data (at least initially).

More information about the original Low Carbon London project, including final reports, is available from https://innovation.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/projects/low-carbon-london/.

#### Types of data

What kind of data did you work with? E.g. categorical and numerical data and their sub-types.

> Remember: **Data Requirements** 
The data you use in the project has to meet the following criteria:
- At least 5,000 rows
- At least 3 sources of data
- Must contain text data, numeric data and dates

#### Data formats

_What format did your data come in? E.g. all downloaded flat files (CSV) or any data from APIs, scraping etc._

All data were downloaded as CSV files from source websites.

#### Data quality and bias

_Briefly describe the quality of the data and whether you have any reasons to suggest the data is biased e.g. only data from a specific demographic even though a broader demographic would be of interest to the organisation._

According to the original research project, "the customers in the trial were recruited as a balanced sample representative of the Greater London population" (]data.london.gov.uk](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/smartmeter-energy-use-data-in-london-households)). _say something about comparing energy use in London v Scotland, population demographics..._

_Note also point above about missing information on customer group (dynamic v fixed tariffs)._

## Ethics

#### Ethical issues in data sourcing and extraction

Do you have any ethical concerns regarding the sourcing and extraction of your data? 

#### Ethical implications of business requirements

Are there any ethical implications of the business requirements?

## Analysis

#### Stages in the data analysis process

What were the main stages in your data analysis process?

#### Tools for data analysis

What were the main tools you used for your analysis?

#### Descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analysis

Please report under which of the below categories your analysis falls **and why** (can be more than one) 

::: {.emphasis}
**Descriptive Analytics** tells you what happened in the past.

**Diagnostic Analytics** helps you understand why something happened in the past.

**Predictive Analytics** predicts what is most likely to happen in the future.

**Prescriptive Analytics** recommends actions you can take to affect those outcomes.
